Github Pages: https://github.com/javierturner/weatherdashboard
Deployed Application: https://javierturner.github.io/weatherdashboard/index.html


## Installation

There is no installation required for this project.


## Usage

The purpose of this was to demonstrate my understanding of using API's from other applications, such as the OpenWeather API.


## Functionality

The website functions by allowing the user to search for a city. Upon clicking the "search" button, there is a function to grab that value, insert it into the URL to make the AJAX call, then display the information pulled from the response.
